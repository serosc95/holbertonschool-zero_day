# Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool that helps us to create and manage virtual machines with the same working environment. It allows us to define the services to be installed as well as their configurations. It is designed to work in local environments and we can use it with shell scripts, Chef, Puppet or Ansible.

It should be noted that Vagrant does not have the capacity to run a virtual machine but simply takes care of the features with which to create that VM and the add-ons to be installed.

To run the virtual machine we will use VirtualBox.

### What is a zero-day

This is a new vulnerability for which no patches or fixes were created, and which is used to carry out an attack. Its name is due to the fact that there is still no patch to mitigate the exploitation of the vulnerability

### What is a virtual machine

It is a software that creates a separate layer where it emulates the operation of a real computer with all the hardware components it needs to function and can run any operating system or program, just as a real computer would.
