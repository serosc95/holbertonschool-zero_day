# Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool that helps us to create and manage virtual machines with the same working environment. It allows us to define the services to be installed as well as their configurations. It is designed to work in local environments and we can use it with shell scripts, Chef, Puppet or Ansible.

It should be noted that Vagrant does not have the capacity to run a virtual machine but simply takes care of the features with which to create that VM and the add-ons to be installed.

To run the virtual machine we will use VirtualBox.

### What is a zero-day

### What is a virtual machine
